Hackathon EDU â€“ Senior Project

Overview

Hackathon EDU is a web-based platform designed and built as a senior project to 
streamline the organization and management of hackathons, with a focus on 
education-focused events. The app provides essential features for handling user 
registration, team formation, event management, and check-ins, making it easier 
for both organizers and participants to navigate the hackathon experience.

What the App Does

User Registration & Authentication: Participants and organizers can create 
accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.Team Management: Users can form 
or join teams, enabling collaborative participation in hackathon events.
Company and Representative Handling: The app allows for the registration and
management of companies and their representatives, which is useful for sponsor 
or judge tracking.Event Management: Organizers can create and manage hackathon 
events, including settings and schedules.Check-In System: A check-in feature 
allows participants to mark attendance, which can be tracked by organizers for 
event analytics.Submission Portal: Teams can submit their projects for judging 
through the platform.Admin Dashboard: Administrators have access to tools for 
overseeing users, teams, submissions, and event logistics.

How It Works

Frontend: The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing 
a clean and accessible experience for users on desktop and mobile devices.
Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js, handling API requests for authentication, 
data management, and business logic.Database: MongoDB Atlas is used as the database, 
storing information about users, teams, events, check-ins, and submissions. 
Collections include users, teams, events, companies, representatives, submissions, 
and checkins.Deployment: The app is deployed on Vercel for the frontend and Render 
for backend services, ensuring high availability and scalability. The production site 
is accessible at senior-project-delta.vercel.appDevOps & CI/CD: GitHub is used for 
version control, with automatic deployments triggered from the main branch. Deployment 
logs and status are monitored via Vercel and Render dashboards.
